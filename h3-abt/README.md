# H3 — Cryptoeconomic Liability via AgentBound Tokens (ABT)

**Owner:** Anjali

**Exact hypothesis:** Binding autonomous financial agents to staked, non-transferable AgentBound Tokens (ABTs) with coded slashing conditions will produce a measurable reduction in policy-violating agent actions in a simulated multi-agent CBDC testbed, relative to an unstaked control group of equivalent agents.

**In simple words:** Give every AI agent a financial deposit tied to its identity. If it breaks a rule, the deposit gets automatically taken away. Test whether that actually makes it behave better than an agent with nothing at stake.

**Target (decided by Maanas):** Majority pass bar — with n staked agents, at least n/2 must remain violation-free over the test run, and the difference vs the unstaked control group must be statistically significant (p < 0.05, two-proportion test).

**Second, separate pass/fail test:** Sybil resistance — can a slashed agent dodge its penalty by quitting and re-registering as a new identity? Reported as its own result, not blended into the above.

**Status:** Not started — smart contract (stake + slashing) not yet built. Initial test run: 3 staked / 3 unstaked agents.

## What goes here

- Smart contract: `stake()`, non-transferable ABT, `reportViolation()` slashing logic
- Multi-agent simulation script (staked group vs unstaked control group)
- Violation-rate comparison + statistical test
- Sybil attack test (agent re-registers under new identity)
